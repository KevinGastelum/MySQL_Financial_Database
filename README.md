This project aims to create a dynamic data dashboard to visualize the top 20 gainers, losers, and most actively traded tickers in the US market, utilizing data from the AlphaVantage API. This dashboard updates daily, providing a clear and concise view of market movers.

## Data Source

The data is retrieved from the AlphaVantage API, specifically using the [TOP_GAINERS_LOSERS](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#gainer-loser) function to fetch the top gainers, losers, and the most actively traded tickers in the US market.
